fixtools - a powerful FixFast financial data analysis and manipulation library for Python
=====================================================================+++++++++++++++++++++
**fixtools** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data
structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both
easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for
doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has
the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data
analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on
its way toward this goal.
Main Features
-------------
Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:
  - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating
    point data
  - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and
    higher dimensional objects
  - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can  be explicitly aligned
    to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let
    `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in
    computations
  - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine
    operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data
  - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python
    and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects
  - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large
    data sets
  - Intuitive merging and joining data sets
  - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
  - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)
  - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),
    Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5
    format
  - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency
    conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions,
    date shifting and lagging, etc.
